      <h1>Hi 👋, I'm Tamilvanan</h1>

      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>
        🔍 Always questioning, thinking from first principles, and testing ideas
        rigorously. I pride myself on not fooling myself and being open to
        changing my mind regularly. Laughter is my constant companion, and I
        approach problem-solving holistically and with a long-term perspective.
        Most importantly, I don't take myself too seriously. Let's build great
        things and have fun doing it! 😄🌱
